# Development Instructions

Since the package.json file is read-only, please use one of the following commands to start the development server:

## Using Node.js directly:
```
node start.js
```

## Using the shell script (Unix/Linux/Mac):
```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Using Vite directly:
```
npx vite
```

Any of these commands will start the Vite development server on port 8080.
